<p>Hey %NAME%,</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for applying to be a volunteer for Make A Difference.</strong> Take a moment and appreciate yourself to have taken the first step towards building a safe network for children in need of care and protection.  MAD is an award-winning non-profit organization that works with more than 3500 children in 60 shelter homes across the nation in 23 cities! We are looking forward to having you as part of our organization. Let us understand MAD a little better.</p>

<p>MAD is a youth-driven, non-profit organization working to ensure better outcomes for vulnerable children in shelters across India. </p>

<p>Our vision is that even the most vulnerable children in shelters are able to realize long-term outcomes equitable with the middle class. We understand the 'most vulnerable' as children who either do not have a family to support them or children whose families are unable to provide a safe space for them to grow up in. Many of the shelters these children end up in, struggle to address more than infrastructure and basic needs, so Make A Difference focuses on providing these children with additional care and support systems to ensure that they flourish and the cycle of poverty and abandonment is broken.</p>

<p>To know more about MAD, please go through our <a href="https://d39uag6u5n989.cloudfront.net/MADWebsite/MAD_Annual_Report_2018-19.pdf">annual report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To be part of Make a difference the below are the primary expectations from a volunteer. </strong></p>

<p>Apart from the primary expectations we also look out for individuals who have <strong>good mobilization skills, sensible and mature</strong> and are willing to <strong>do whatever it takes for however long it takes attitude</strong>. If you see yourself as a person with these characteristics then this is a collective you will thrive in.</p>

<p>We are excited to have you. Are you? If yes this is your way forward as an applicant!</p>
